# Egg-Inc.-Calculator
Just a simple tool to check if you'll complete your contract

The important thing is this : You need to write down your rate of eggs per hour at some point in your day, let's say 2 pm
A few hours after, you write down your updated rate of eggs per hour, let's say at 7 pm
Every other value you can just check, but I need a reference point to know how much you're gaining every few hours

Ok so here are the values that interest us

 1. Time remaining in the contract (in hours)
 2. Total eggs earned by the team
 3. The goal of eggs you are aiming for, usually the end of contract
 4. Your CURRENT rate of eggs per hour
 5. How long ago you wrote down your egg laying rate per hour (in our example that's 5 hours) this CAN have decimals like 4.5 hours or 6.75
 6. You PREVIOUS rate of eggs per hour, in our example that's at 2 pm
 
 
THAT IS ALL
You will then get the answer to whether you'll finish the contract in time
This is NOT perfect, for better results be precise in your values, most important being the delay of hours between the two measurements
